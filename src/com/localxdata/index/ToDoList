1.We should use the index to make search fast (FINISH)
  ->1.query condition one ->FINISH (eg: a > 100)
  ->2.multi query condition ->TODO(eg: a > 100 && b < 100)
  
2.Add equal condition.(FINISH)

3.Add delete/add synchronization.Also insert index and delete index should
  not be done at the same time(TODO!!)
  eg:
  1.Class Node Member:ArrayList<Node> equalList
     
  
4.Add remove index operation...(TODO)
 ->we can add a flag to mark whether the node need to be deleted.
   if we visit the node over 100 times,we do real delete action.
   Also,if we add a new node,if we can replace the delete node with the
   new node,speed will be faster.
