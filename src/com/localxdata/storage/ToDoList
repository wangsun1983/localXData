We should use btree to make db smaller.
Because if we save 50K records in a file,
the io opreation will cost large memory and 
a lot of time.Also if we only need to change
one records in the 50K records,we need not
to write all the records to file again.we can
write to the file which the data was saved in.

Defination
1.The db table's name is table2db.xml ->FINISH

2.All the db's name should save like xxxx_1.xml ->FINISH

3.When we refresh db,we should not write all the xml files again.
  We can only write the xml whose data was modified. ->TODO
  
4.SaveHandler.findDataCellByBlocknum ->Finish

5.We should rewrite the file whose data was changed ->TODO
